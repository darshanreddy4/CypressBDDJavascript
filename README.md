# Welcome to the **Cypress Automation Framework** with **Cucumber**! 🎉🚀

Welcome to the future of automated testing! We've taken **Cypress** and sprinkled it with some **Cucumber** magic to make your tests more readable, maintainable, and yes, a little more fun. 🧙‍♂️✨

Now you can write your tests in **Gherkin syntax**—because who doesn't want to write tests that read like a bedtime story? Whether you're a developer, tester, or product manager, this framework is designed to make you look like a testing wizard. 🧑‍💻⚡

## Key Features:
- **Cypress & Cucumber**: The dynamic duo of testing—faster than a speeding bug, stronger than flaky tests. 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️  
- **Gherkin Syntax**: Write your tests in plain English with **Given, When, Then**—finally, a testing language even your grandma could understand! 👵📜  
- **In-Sprint Automation**: Like having a robot friend that runs your tests while you work on the next big feature. 🤖💼  

## How to Get Started:
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.  
3. Run the tests with `npx cypress run --env tags="@demo1" --headed`.
4. Watch the magic unfold as your tests run in **Gherkin** style! ✨

### "Write your tests like a story, and let the framework do the rest!" 📖💻  
No plot twists here—just smooth, automated testing.

This basic framework was created and maintained by **Darshanreddy M G**. I hope you find it useful to kick start with Cypress and fun to use. If you run into issues, have feedback, or just want to chat, feel free to connect with me on Teams. I’ll be the one sending you emoji reactions. 😎👨‍💻

Happy testing! 🧑‍💻🎉
